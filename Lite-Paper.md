Connecting Decentralized AI with Autonomous AI Agent Swarms

Version 1.999 | January 2024

## **Executive Summary**

Built by BitMind, Seraph is an advanced autonomous AI agent that integrates the Virtuals Protocol’s G.A.M.E. agent framework and the open-source ElizaOS framework with Bittensor subnets. These subnets operate under a competitive incentive structure that continuously pushes AI models towards and often beyond state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks in academia and industry. For example, Subnet 34, directly managed by BitMind, regularly exceeds these benchmarks by accurately assessing whether user-shared media are AI-generated, showcasing its practical value in real-world scenarios.

This initiative is the first of its kind, combining Virtuals Protocol's agent ecosystem with Bittensor’s decentralized intelligence network, creating a new paradigm for the development of intelligent, autonomous agents. Seraph embodies the integration of several core technological ecosystems:

- **Bittensor Subnets**: A decentralized network for AI model training and inference.
- **Virtuals' Agent Framework**: A modular infrastructure for building and orchestrating autonomous agents.
- **Base's Scaling Infrastructure**: A scalable blockchain platform optimized for high throughput and low latency.
- **Eliza Plugin (BitMind Bittensor Plugin)**: Enhances the operational capabilities of the Seraph agent within the decentralized network.

Looking forward, Seraph plans to enhance its functionality by integrating additional Bittensor subnets, broadening its application spectrum across various AI tasks and continuously refining its technological prowess. Supported by Base’s robust infrastructure and BitMind’s Eliza plugin, Seraph is set to maintain its technological lead.

The ultimate aim for Seraph is to dominate the Web3 space as the premier AI agent, leading the integration of autonomous agents with decentralized intelligence networks. This approach positions Seraph not just as a technological pioneer but also as a key driver in the expansion and evolution of autonomous agent ecosystems across the blockchain.

### **The Vision: Beyond the Matrix**

Seraph aims to distribute the powerful AI created on Bittensor by serving as a bridge between Bittensor's decentralized intelligence and end-users. Unlike other web3 AI agents, Seraph connects users directly to cutting-edge specialized AI models running on Bittensor subnets, enabling access to advanced capabilities such as deepfake detection and agent verification. With an expanding number of subnets and constant AI innnovation happening on Bittensor the potential feature set of Seraph is endless.

## **Key Features and Capabilities**

The system's initial implementation, leveraging a combination of Bittensor commodities and Opacity, a ZKTLS solution built on Eigenlayer that enables verifiable inference, uniquely addresses both consumer-facing content verification and the emerging challenges of verification in the autonomous agent economy. This establishes a foundation for trust in the age of AI while demonstrating the vast potential of cross-platform integration in the AI ecosystem.

### **Bittensor Intelligence Oracle Integration**

The Bittensor Intelligence Oracle (BIO) is an API service that provides comprehensive access to the supercommodities of Bittensor's subnetworks. The Seraph Agent serves as a proof-of-concept form factor for the mass distribution of these supercommodities. Seraph's intelligence scales alongside Bittensor innovation—new subnets unlock novel capabilities, while improvements to existing subnets immediately enhance Seraph's functionality.

### **Multi-Agent DeAI Economy**

Leveraging Virtuals Protocol, the Eliza framework, and Bittensor Subnets, Seraph democratizes the flow of value and revenue, enabling scalable, trustless, and collaborative interactions within the decentralized AI economy.

### **Proof of Autonomy**

The absence of reliable verification systems has severe economic consequences. With over $500 million invested in unverified autonomous agents, the market faces significant risks due to the misallocation of capital. Approximately 70% of trending agents lack verifiable autonomy metrics, creating an environment ripe for manipulation and fraudulent activity. This situation leads to growing skepticism among investors and users, threatening the development of legitimate autonomous agents and stifling the growth of the agent economy.

Seraph integrates Opacity's ZKTLS framework to provide verifiable proof of inference, ensuring that autonomous agents operate transparently and can be authenticated without revealing sensitive data. This mechanism enhances trust and reliability within the AI ecosystem.

### **Autonomy Bounties & Rewards**

To incentivize the verification of AI agents, Seraph plans to introduce Autonomy Bounties, rewarding users and validators who contribute to maintaining a robust and accountable AI ecosystem. More details on the implementation will be shared as the system progresses.

## **Seraph's System Architecture**

The Bitmind Bittensor Intelligence Oracle (Unified API) provides comprehensive access to Bittensor's specialized and niche intelligence. This decentralized intelligence has demonstrated superiority across various applications and strategies. The Seraph Agent serves as a proof of concept, integrating essential technical innovations to enhance autonomous decision-making in diverse agent applications.

## **Economic Model and Incentives**

### **$Seraph Tokenomics and Governance**

Seraph's token ($Seraph) implements a dual-purpose economic model combining value capture and governance:

**Value Capture Mechanisms:**

- Seraph Inference Payments
- Revenue from enterprise integrations and API usage
- Virtuals Protocol Emissions
- Trading Fees

**Governance Architecture:**

- Blend between SubDAO and Bittensor subnets' governance
- Governance scope includes:
  - Fee parameters and distribution
  - Seraph feature prioritization
  - Treasury management
  - Seraph upgrade decisions
  - Models validation

**External Staking Benefits:**

- stTAO rewards
- Seraph yield
- WAI Combinator yield
- Basket of Agent assets across different protocols
- Seraph revenue from operations and trading fees

### **TAO Integration and Token Accumulation Mechanism**

At the core of Seraph's economic model lies an approach to value accrual through the systematic accumulation of Bittensor's TAO. Unlike traditional token models that split revenues across various stakeholders, Seraph takes a bold approach by directing fees toward TAO acquisition.

This complete dedication to TAO accumulation positions Seraph as an increasingly significant participant in the Bittensor ecosystem. As usage grows, the automated conversion of fees into TAO creates a steadily expanding treasury that strengthens Seraph's position within the broader Bittensor network and emerges as the important Agent in Virtuals AI Agents Swarm.

## **Roadmap**

The initial phase focuses on building the foundational components needed to expand Seraph into a powerful agent with specialized capabilities. This includes establishing core detection systems, stabilizing network architecture, and implementing validation protocols. These building blocks will enable Seraph to leverage various Bittensor subnets, each adding unique specialized features and intelligence to the agent's growing capabilities.

The early development prioritizes creating a robust infrastructure that can support the seamless integration of new Bittensor subnet functionalities as they become available, ensuring Seraph can continuously expand its utility and effectiveness.

## **By March 2025**

- **Bittensor Unified API integrated with Seraph** (Authenticity + subnets related to non-authenticity use cases).
- **Proof of Market Valuation**, backed by revenue projections/utility.
- **DeFAI integration** (Unified API with **Chainlink Functions**).
- **WAI Combinator, DKING, GEKKO, Vader swaps** for a more **diversified Seraph treasury**; additional **Agent token swaps** (related to co-building or authenticity reports).
- **Virtuals and Eliza Bittensor plugin** (potentially supporting other frameworks).
- **Improve Seraph's online presence** and usability through **GAME + Eliza**.
